Netflix Clone is a MERN stack application inspired by Netflix, offering
functionalities such as user authentication, movie browsing, and
watchlist management.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies for both backend and
frontend.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/yaksh9737/Netflix-clone.git
cd Netflix-clone
```

### Backend Setup

Navigate to the `backend` folder and install dependencies:

``` bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following
content:

``` bash
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
```

Replace placeholders with your configurations: - `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB
connection string - `JWT_SECRET`: JSON Web Token secret -
`TMDB_API_KEY`: API key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

Build and start the backend server:

``` bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Frontend Setup

Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install dependencies:

``` bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory with the following
content:

``` bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Start the frontend server:

``` bash
npm run build
